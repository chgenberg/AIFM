# AIFM Agent Portal – Project Status (Oct 2025)

## ✅ Completed (Phase 1: Foundation)

### Infrastructure
- [x] Monorepo setup (apps/web, apps/api, apps/workers, packages/shared, packages/ai)

- [x] Prisma schema (15+ models: Client, Report, Task, LedgerEntry, etc.)
- [x] Docker Compose (PostgreSQL + Redis for local development)
- [x] TypeScript configuration (monorepo-wide)
- [x] Environment template (.env.example)

### Database
- [x] Complete Prisma schema with:
  - Client management (tier, contacts, subscriptions)
  - Data feeds (Fortnox, Bank, Allvue, etc.)
  - Ledger & transactions
  - Tasks & flags (QC workflows)
  - Reports & evidence (immutable copies)
  - KYC, Investors, Risk profiles
  - Audit logs (full traceability)

### Queue Infrastructure

## Quick Start (For Your Team)

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
cd /Users/christophergenberg/Desktop/FINANS
npm install
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Setup Database
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Run Workers (Dev)
```bash
npm run dev -w apps/workers
```

Test manual sync:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/datafeeds/[id]/sync
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No Frontend Yet:** Portal UI not started; focus was infrastructure
2. **Python Workers Called Inline:** No separate Python service; Node spawns subprocess
3. **Limited LLM Integration:** Report drafting is rule-based; could be enhanced with GPT-4
4. **Stub Implementations:** PEP/sanction checks, KYC OCR not integrated
5. **No Monitoring:** Sentry/OpenTelemetry not wired; health endpoint skeleton only

---

## Decision Log

- **Monorepo (Yarn Workspaces):** Enables code sharing between web/workers/ai
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL:** Type-safe schema, migrations built-in
- **BullMQ:** Redis-native, excellent for scaling; simple concurrency
- **Python for AI:** Industry standard; easy integration via subprocess
- **Clerk Auth:** OAuth SSO + Magic Link backup; minimal ops
- **Zod Validation:** Runtime type safety across service boundaries

---

## Success Metrics (MVP)

- [x] Data ingestion from 2+ sources (Fortnox, Bank)
- [x] Automated QC checks on ledger
- [x] AI-drafted investor reports
- [ ] Portal UI for coordinator/specialist workflows
- [ ] End-to-end: Upload → ETL → QC → Approval → PDF publish
- [ ] <3 hours to first report after data upload

---

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 2 (Portal):** 4–6 weeks
  - Frontend UI + workflows (3–4 weeks)
  - API endpoints (2 weeks, parallel)
  
- **Phase 3 (Extended):** 8–10 weeks
  - LLM + advanced AI (2 weeks)
  - Additional ETL connectors (2 weeks)
  - Investor onboarding (3 weeks)
  - Risk + compliance (3 weeks)

**Total MVP to Production:** ~3–4 months
