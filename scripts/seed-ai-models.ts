   - WARNING: Issues that should be reviewed (timing differences, rounding errors)
   - INFO: Normal reconciliation items (timing differences <5 days, small amounts)

4. Provide concrete recommendations for action

DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:
- Timing differences are COMMON and usually normal (not critical)
- Amounts under 10,000 SEK are often rounding errors
- Management fees are typically debited monthly
- Capital calls appear as large inflows
- Swedish fund regulations require reconciliation T+3
