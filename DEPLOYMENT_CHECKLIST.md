# AIFM Agent Portal ‚Äì Deployment Checklist & Launch Guide

**Status:** 100% MVP COMPLETE ‚úÖ  
**Ready for:** Production deployment (same day possible)

---

## üöÄ PRE-DEPLOYMENT (1-2 hours)

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Create `.env.local` in `apps/web/` (Clerk keys)
- [ ] Create `.env.local` in `apps/api/` (DATABASE_URL, CLERK_SECRET)
- [ ] Create `.env.local` in `apps/workers/` (REDIS_URL, DATABASE_URL)
- [ ] Verify all 3 `.env.local` files have same DB/Redis URLs

### 2. Local Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start database & Redis
docker-compose up -d

# Terminal 2: Run migrations
npm run db:push

# Terminal 3: Start workers
npm run dev -w apps/workers

# Terminal 4: Start portal
npm run dev -w apps/web

# Terminal 5: Start API (if separate)
# npm run dev -w apps/api
```

- [ ] Login works (Clerk auth)
- [ ] Navigate to `/coordinator/inbox` ‚Äì loads QC tasks
- [ ] Navigate to `/client/dashboard` ‚Äì loads datafeeds
- [ ] Navigate to `/specialist/board` ‚Äì loads report kanban
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/dashboard` ‚Äì shows health check
- [ ] API call from Portal works (`GET /api/tasks`)

### 3. Database Check
```sql
-- In psql:
\d Client
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Client";
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Task";
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AuditLog";
```

- [ ] All tables created
- [ ] Can query data
- [ ] Indexes are present

---

## üåê PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (Railway)

### 1. Create Railway Services

**PostgreSQL:**
```
Service: PostgreSQL 16
- Name: aifm-postgres
- Region: Europe (Frankfurt)
- Size: Starter
```

**Redis:**
```
Service: Redis 7
- Name: aifm-redis
- Region: Europe (Frankfurt)
- Eviction policy: allkeys-lru
```

**Web App (Next.js Portal + API):**
```
Service: Deploy from GitHub
- Repo: your-repo
- Branch: main
- Build command: npm run build -w apps/web
- Start command: npm run start -w apps/web
- Name: aifm-web
- Region: Europe
```

**Workers (Node + Python):**
```
Service: Deploy from GitHub
- Repo: your-repo
- Branch: main
- Build command: npm run build -w apps/workers
- Start command: npm run dev -w apps/workers
- Name: aifm-workers
- Region: Europe
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Railway Dashboard)

**For Web Service:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
DATABASE_URL=${{ PostgreSQL.DATABASE_URL }}
REDIS_URL=${{ Redis.REDIS_URL }}
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://aifm-web.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

**For API Service (if separate):**
```
DATABASE_URL=${{ PostgreSQL.DATABASE_URL }}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://aifm-web.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

**For Workers Service:**
```
DATABASE_URL=${{ PostgreSQL.DATABASE_URL }}
REDIS_URL=${{ Redis.REDIS_URL }}
NODE_ENV=production
```

- [ ] All services linked to same DB/Redis
- [ ] Clerk keys are production keys
- [ ] NODE_ENV=production on all services

### 3. Deploy & Test
```bash
# Push to GitHub main branch
git push origin main

# Railway auto-deploys (watch logs)
```

- [ ] Portal loads (check Cloudflare DNS)
- [ ] Can login with Clerk
- [ ] API calls work (check Network tab)
- [ ] Check logs: `railway logs` or Railway dashboard
- [ ] Health check: GET `/api/admin/health`

### 4. Database Migration (Production)
```bash
# SSH into Railway Web service
npm run db:push

# Or run prisma migrate:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

- [ ] All tables created
- [ ] Indexes applied
- [ ] No pending migrations

---

## ‚úÖ POST-DEPLOYMENT (Verification)

### 1. Health Checks
- [ ] `/api/admin/health` returns 200 ‚úÖ
- [ ] Database: "healthy"
- [ ] Queue: "healthy"
- [ ] Response time < 500ms

### 2. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Can signup via Clerk
- [ ] Can login via Clerk
- [ ] Role-based redirect works (CLIENT ‚Üí /client/dashboard)
- [ ] RBAC middleware blocks unauthorized routes

### 3. Core Workflows
**Coordinator:**
- [ ] Can access `/coordinator/inbox`
- [ ] Can see QC tasks
- [ ] Can approve tasks ‚Üí `POST /api/tasks/[id]/approve`
- [ ] Audit log records action

**Specialist:**
- [ ] Can access `/specialist/board`
- [ ] Can see report kanban
- [ ] Can edit report text
- [ ] Can publish report

**Client:**
- [ ] Can access `/client/dashboard`
- [ ] Can see datafeeds
- [ ] Can trigger sync ‚Üí `POST /api/datafeeds/[id]/sync`
- [ ] Can see reports

**Admin:**
- [ ] Can access `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Can see system health
- [ ] Can see queue status

### 4. Data Persistence
```sql
-- Check in Railway PostgreSQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AuditLog";  -- Should grow with each action
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Task";      -- Should show created tasks
```

- [ ] Data writes to DB
- [ ] Audit logs recorded
- [ ] No errors in logs

### 5. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Sentry linked (optional but recommended):
  ```
  SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/xxx
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
  ```
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Error tracking active

---

## üîí SECURITY CHECKLIST

- [ ] **Secrets not in code** ‚Äì All in Railway env vars
- [ ] **HTTPS enforced** ‚Äì Railway auto-redirects
- [ ] **CORS configured** ‚Äì API only accepts requests from web domain
- [ ] **Rate limiting** ‚Äì API throttles to 3 req/sec per IP
- [ ] **SQL Injection protected** ‚Äì Prisma parameterizes queries
- [ ] **XSS protected** ‚Äì React auto-escapes content
- [ ] **RBAC enforced** ‚Äì Middleware checks roles
- [ ] **Clerk integration secure** ‚Äì Session tokens validated

---

## üìä PERFORMANCE BASELINE

After deployment, monitor these:
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms (p99)
- **Page Load Time:** < 3s
- **Database Query Time:** < 100ms
- **Queue Processing:** < 5min per job
- **Error Rate:** < 0.5%

```
Target metrics:
‚úÖ API: 90-120ms average
‚úÖ Portal: 2-2.5s page load
‚úÖ Queue: 60-90s per job
‚úÖ Uptime: 99.5%+
```

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Portal won't load
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs -s aifm-web

# Common issues:
# - Clerk keys wrong ‚Üí verify in Railway
# - Database not migrated ‚Üí run npm run db:push
# - NODE_ENV not set ‚Üí set to "production"
```

### API returns 500
```bash
# Check API logs
railway logs -s aifm-api

# Common issues:
# - Database URL wrong ‚Üí verify ${{ PostgreSQL.DATABASE_URL }}
# - Prisma migration pending ‚Üí run migrate deploy
# - Env vars not set ‚Üí check Railway dashboard
```

### Jobs not processing
```bash
# Check workers logs
railway logs -s aifm-workers

# Common issues:
# - Redis not reachable ‚Üí check REDIS_URL
# - BullMQ not initialized ‚Üí check node_modules
# - Jobs queued but not running ‚Üí check worker concurrency
```

### Can't login
```bash
# Check Clerk settings:
# - Public key matches NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# - Secret key matches CLERK_SECRET_KEY
# - Allowed origins includes your domain
# - Clerk user exists and is active
```
